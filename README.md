# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning & Streamlit

This project predicts the price of a used car based on various features such as brand, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, mileage, engine capacity, and more.  
It combines **Machine Learning** for price prediction and an interactive **Streamlit web app** for deployment.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

## 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction

## 2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3. Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py

## 4. Open in Browser
The app will be available at:
http://localhost:8501/

🧩 Features of the Web App

- Select Car Brand from dropdown.
- Enter details such as:
    - Manufacturing year
    - Kilometers driven
    - Fuel type
    - Transmission
    - Owner type
    - Mileage, Engine CC, Max Power, Seats
- Get an instant predicted car price.

📊 Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Extracted car brand names.
    - Handled categorical variables via encoding.
    - Converted textual values into numerical labels.

2. Model Training:
    - Trained ML model using regression techniques.
    - Saved model as model.pkl.

3. Deployment:
    - Streamlit app (app.py) loads model and takes user input.
    - Predicts price and displays in INR (₹).
